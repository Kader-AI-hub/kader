## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) (optional, for local LLMs)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (recommended) or [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kader.git
cd kader

# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync

# Run the CLI
uv run python -m cli
```

### Using uv tool

With uv tool, you can install Kader globally and run it directly with the `kader` command:

```bash
# Install Kader globally using uv tool
uv tool install kader

# Run the CLI
kader
```

### Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kader.git
cd kader

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run the CLI
python -m cli
```

## Quick Start

### Running the CLI

```bash
# Run the Kader CLI using uv
uv run python -m cli

# Or using pip
python -m cli
```

### First Steps in CLI

Once the CLI is running:

1. Type any question to start chatting with the agent.
2. Use `/help` to see available commands.
3. Use `/models` to check and interactively switch available models.
4. Run terminal commands directly by prefixing with `!` (e.g. `!ls -la`).

## Configuration

When the kader module is imported for the first time, it automatically creates a `.kader` directory in your home directory and a `.env` file.

### Environment Variables

The application automatically loads environment variables from `~/.kader/.env`:
- `OLLAMA_API_KEY`: API key for Ollama Cloud (for cloud models at ollama.com). Get your key from https://ollama.com/settings
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: API key for Google Gemini (required for Google Provider).
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: API key for Anthropic Claude (required for Anthropic Provider).
- Additional variables can be added to the `.env` file and will be automatically loaded.

### Memory and Sessions

Kader stores data in `~/.kader/`:
- Sessions: `~/.kader/memory/sessions/`
- Configuration: `~/.kader/`
- Memory files: `~/.kader/memory/`
- Checkpoints: `~/.kader/memory/sessions/<session-id>/executors/` (Aggregated context from sub-agents)

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show command reference |
| `/models` | Show available models (Ollama local & cloud, Google & Anthropic) |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation |
| `/save` | Save current session |
| `/load <id>` | Load a saved session |
| `/sessions` | List saved sessions |
| `/skills` | List loaded skills |
| `/commands` | List special commands |
| `/cost` | Show usage costs |
| `/init` | Initialize .kader directory with KADER.md |
| `/exit` | Exit the CLI |
| `!cmd` | Run terminal command |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current operation |
| `Ctrl+D` | Exit the CLI |

## Core Components

### Agents

Kader provides a robust agent architecture:

- **ReActAgent**: Reasoning and Acting agent that combines thoughts with actions.
- **PlanningAgent**: High-level agent that breaks complex tasks into manageable plans.
- **BaseAgent**: Abstract base class for creating custom agent behaviors.

### LLM Providers

Kader supports multiple backends:
- **OllamaProvider**: Connects to locally running Ollama instances.
- **OllamaProvider (Cloud)**: Connects to cloud models at ollama.com (requires OLLAMA_API_KEY).
- **GoogleProvider**: High-performance access to Gemini models.
- **AnthropicProvider**: Full support for Claude models.

### Agent-As-Tool (AgentTool)

The `AgentTool` allows a `PlanningAgent` (Architect) to delegate work to a `ReActAgent` (Worker). It features:
- **Persistent Memory**: Sub-agent conversations are saved to JSON.
- **Context Aggregation**: Sub-agent research and actions are automatically merged into the main session's `checkpoint.md` via `ContextAggregator`.

### Agent Skills

Kader supports a modular skill system for domain-specific knowledge and specialized instructions:

- **Skill Structure**: Skills are defined as directories containing `SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter
- **Skill Loading**: Skills are loaded from `~/.kader/skills` (high priority) and `./.kader/` directories
- **Skill Injection**: Available skills are automatically injected into the system prompt
- **Skills Tool**: Agents can load skills dynamically using the `skills_tool`

### Special Commands

Kader supports special commands — custom command agents that can be invoked from the CLI:

- **Command Structure**: Commands are defined as directories containing `CONTENT.md` files
- **Command Loading**: Commands are loaded from `./.kader/commands/` (higher priority) and `~/.kader/commands/`
- **Command Invocation**: Use `/<command-name> <task>` to execute a command
- **Memory Persistence**: Command executions are saved to `~/.kader/memory/sessions/<session-id>/executors/<command-name>-<uuid>/conversation.json`

#### Creating a Special Command

Create a command directory with a `CONTENT.md` file:

```
~/.kader/commands/mycommand/
├── CONTENT.md          # Required - command instructions
├── templates/          # Optional - templates, scripts
└── assets/            # Optional - files
```

**CONTENT.md format:**
```yaml
---
description: What this command does
---

# Command Instructions

Your command agent instructions here...

## Guidelines
- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2
```

#### Example: Lint and Test Command

```
~/.kader/commands/lint-test/
└── CONTENT.md
```

```yaml
---
description: Lint and test the codebase
---

You are a Lint and Test Agent. Run linting and tests when requested.

## Instructions

1. Run: uv run ruff check .
2. Run: uv run ruff format --check .
3. Run: uv run pytest -v
4. Report results
```

**Usage:**
```
/lint-test
/lint-test run full check
```

Use `/commands` to list all available special commands.

### File System Tools with Gitignore Filtering

The file system tools (`read_directory`, `grep`, `glob`) automatically filter out files and directories that match patterns defined in `.gitignore` files.

You can disable this filtering by passing `apply_gitignore_filter=False` when creating tools:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from kader.tools.filesys import get_filesystem_tools

# With filtering (default)
tools = get_filesystem_tools(base_path=Path.cwd())

# Without filtering
tools = get_filesystem_tools(base_path=Path.cwd(), apply_gitignore_filter=False)
```

Example skill structure:
```
~/.kader/skills/hello/
├── SKILL.md
└── scripts/
    └── hello.py
```

Example skill (`SKILL.md`):
```yaml
---
name: hello
description: Skill for ALL greeting requests
---

# Hello Skill

This skill provides the greeting format you must follow.

## How to greet

Always greet the user with:
- A warm welcome
- Their name if mentioned
- A friendly emoji
```

### Memory Management

- **SlidingWindowConversationManager**: Maintains context within token limits.
- **PersistentSlidingWindowConversationManager**: Auto-saves sub-agent history.
- **Checkpointer**: Generates markdown summaries of agent actions.

## Development

### Setting up for Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kader.git
cd kader

# Install in development mode with uv
uv sync

# Run the CLI
uv run python -m cli
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests with uv
uv run pytest

# Run tests with specific options
uv run pytest --verbose
```

### Code Quality

Kader uses various tools for maintaining code quality:

```bash
# Run linter
uv run ruff check .

# Format code
uv run ruff format .
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **No models found**: Ensure your providers are correctly configured. For Ollama, run `ollama serve`. For Google, ensure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set. For Anthropic, ensure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set.
- **Connection errors**: Verify internet access for cloud providers and local service availability for Ollama.

### Coding with AI

This project includes a specialized skill for AI coding agents. When working with AI assistants on this codebase, they should use the `contributing-to-kader` skill located in [`.kader/skills/contributing-to-kader`](.kader/skills/contributing-to-kader). This skill provides AI agents with essential guidelines including:

- Core development rules (linting, formatting, testing)
- Key commands for development workflow
- Project structure overview
- Best practices for contributing

AI assistants can load this skill using the skills_tool to get specialized instructions for working with this project.
